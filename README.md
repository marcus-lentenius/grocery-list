A private grocery list web app with so far a single purpose of simplifying a trip to the store.

Primary function is to automatically sort the added items/products in the list after a reference list so they appear in the same manner the isles are placed in a store (with categories/isles and currently about 900 products).

Minor functionality added so far is:
 - Possibility to add recipe presets for adding a whole list of ingredients in respective recipe(or whatever preset you'd like).
 - Alist of suggested items/products to add based on the history of the amount of completed items/products(future functionality is to base the suggestions based on the time        difference of between the time of completion for example buy toothpaste every other month).
 - If an item/product is not in the reference list you can manually add it to the category of your choice(future functionality is the freely add/remove items and categories).
 - Import of items/products from Todoist (which me and my wife currently use) until this app is stable enough.

 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
